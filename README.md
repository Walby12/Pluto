# PLUTO

Stack Based Language written in go-lang. 
This is my first compiler so dont expect anything good.
The language is in active development.

## Quick Start

'''console
$ go run pluto.go sim (to simulate the program)
$ go run pluto.go com (to compiler the program)
$ ./out (to run the executable if you have compiled)
'''
