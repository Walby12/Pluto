# PLUTO

Stack Based Language written in go-lang. 
This is my first compiler so dont expect anything good.
The language is in active development.
And for now it only compiles to native arm64 assembly.


## Quick Start

```console
$ go run pluto.go sim <filename/dir>(to simulate the program)
$ go run pluto.go com <filename/dir>(to compiler the program)
$ ./out (to run the executable if you have compiled)
